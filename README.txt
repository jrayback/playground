This is a test readme file.

Now I'm adding text just to make some changes and push to master!

What if I change (seriously?) it here?  Can I pull the changes down?

OK now I'll edit this here and push it back up to GitHub.

Blah blah..OK now I'll practice adding first before committing.

Now I want to pull this change down to my local repo.

<<<<<<< HEAD
OK.  One last change!
